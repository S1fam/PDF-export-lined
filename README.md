# PDF GENERATION

from topics.csv file inside the folder takes a number of topic, name of the topic and amount of pages for the topic.
Then creates PDF file which contains name of the topic on the top and then amount of blank pages specified in csv file. (page with topic name counts as blank aswell).
This app might be use to generate and print pages to take notes on, also you might need to edit the csv file to your need without breaking its format. same as PDF export repository i have, but this code makes lines on the page in the pdf output.
